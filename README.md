# Usage

## Download and generate data
First, you need to download the 291 images dataset ([Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10Ea6OCxNktlL635TJrBhPwiHjD1Vxzm_), [Baidu NetDisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1mciEH45l7bC5bkHmV4s7SQ) (password:3rpa)) and unzip it in the directory in "./data/".

Next, you need to generate the ".h5" formate of 291 dataset. You can use the matlab code "generate_train.m" provided in "./matlab" to generate the 2x, 3x, 4x datasets.

## Training
1. Use the following command for training MTO based ensemble.
```
python main_train.py -c configs/stacksr.json
```

2. Use the following command for training MTO based ensemble without knowledge transfer,
```
python main_train.py -c configs/stacksr_nonet.json
```

3. Use the following command for training MTO based ensemble with identical upscaling method,
```
python main_train.py -c configs/stacksr_3drrn.json
python main_train.py -c configs/stacksr_3vdsr.json
python main_train.py -c configs/stacksr_3lap.json
```

After training, the generated models are stored in folder "experiments".

## Testing
Use the following command for testing,
```
python main_test.py -c configs/stacksr.json
```
Modify the -c parameter to adapt your model.

## Plot
The figures can be generated via the script "get_curve.py". Note it should be run after training.
